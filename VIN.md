Vin for the 2006 Hummer Alpha Duramax 

137 
P (Duramax*)
H (Allison Transmission*)
90 (HMCO - that didn't change)
3 (GVWR stays the same)
1 (Check Digit)
6 (2006 Model Year - No surprise there!)
E (Mishawaka)

My 10th and 11th VIN digits are NE which I think the site states indicates it is a limited edition but elsewhere I have seen that the serial number must begin with 135XXX and mine is 130XXX. 

Actually, not so.  There were several 1992 model year HUMMERs (H1) built that were NOT "Limited Edition."  Also, there were many 1993 model year HUMMERs with lower serial numbers than many 1992 model year HUMMERs.  FYI: Not all Limited Edition HUMMERs had a "Limited Edition" plate attached to them when they left the factory.

It's desert sand in color but not sure if that means anything. Depending on several factors, it could have left the factory with 50% Gloss"Commercial Tan" paint or 50% Gloss paint buffed up to a higher gloss.
