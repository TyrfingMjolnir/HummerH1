## Misc Hummer H1 information

The information found here is mostly for the civil version H1 or H1 Alpha, while the military knowledge will not be excluded, I'm not hesitant to post auxilary tools of a rougher nature. Personally I'm working on a barbeque square mounted for the vehicle, based off of Char-Broil professional pro 3 burner.

Such as [the VIN decoding chart](VIN.md).

The grille and its [dimensions](thegrille.md).

Vehicle [models](models.md).
